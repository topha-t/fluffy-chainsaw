      <header>The know around about Hell</header>
      <section>I'm sure you are wonder how this lovely little town got such a devilish name. Well it’s just that, no one knows for sure! There are currently two theory’s about how it got its disarming name. The first being 2 Germans were traveling and said the place was "So Schön hell!" which means "So bright!" and I bet it was.
      <br>
        The other theory is that the founder of the town was asked what to name it and he just responded with "I don't care. You can name it Hell for all I care.". Any of those could be very true, but it could just be because of the climate there, as it's very "hellish" with loads of mosquitos!</section>
